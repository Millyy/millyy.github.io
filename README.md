My personal website! You can check it out at https://www.celiastokman.com
The goal was to make a simple website for people interested in seeing things that I've done, mostly from internships and projects.

## Latest Update
Changed the fonts to make the website feel a bit more personal. I used my own handwriting and https://www.calligraphr.com to make a new font that looks like how I'd write if I wrote my a's exactly the same way every time, and didn't smudge the letters with my left-handedness. Also a cat that winks at you, cause who can resist that.
Yay, learning!

~~New issue! www.celiastokman.com doesn't work! Only celiastokman.com! Attempting to fix tonight with Firebase...~~ Fixed!

## Things I've learned
- More JavaScript, HTML and CSS techniques
- How mockups in Photoshop help to make a website with better visual flow
- Setting up Firebase (Hosting has been moved to Firebase for added security! At the time of writing this, the SSL certificate is now processing. The safer address is https://portfolio-site-8d87b.firebaseapp.com/)
- About meta tags and search engine optimization
- How to do the "open command line here" thing since the new Windows 10 update changed it to PowerShell. If you type cmd in the File Explorer address bar, it opens the command line to wherever you've navigated to. Handy!
- How to make your own font and embed it into a website!

## Challenges
- Initially I used CSS variables for better flexibility, but learned that they are not compatible with older versions of Internet Explorer
- Learned that minifying CSS and JavaScript is a standard convention in the field
- Unable to publicise code from internship projects

## Things to do
