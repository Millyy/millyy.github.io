My personal website! You can check it out at http://www.celiastokman.com
The goal was to make a simple website for people interested in seeing things that I've done, mostly from internships and projects.

## Things I've learned
- More JavaScript, HTML and CSS techniques
- How mockups in Photoshop help to make a website with better visual flow

## Challenges
- Initially I used CSS variables for better flexibility, but learned that they are not compatible with older versions of Internet Explorer
- Learned that minifying CSS and JavaScript is a standard convention in the field
- Unable to publicise code from internship projects

## Things to do
- Figure out how to make the website HTTPS. github.io does not support LetsEncrypt.com
- Improve responsiveness
- Change image border style?
- Add more turtles
