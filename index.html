		<p>The Asia New Zealand Foundation gave me the amazing opportunity to travel across the world to experience
		working as a developer in a Japanese work environment.</p>
		<p>Here, I experienced first-hand the differences in development cycles and team environments. I learned
		the importance of recognising differing requirements when creating a product to be used in a country with unique
		values and preferences, as well as customising apps to best support another language.</p>
		<p>My team took advantage of PHP, and I learned why it's the most popular language used to this day. Since it was
		such a large company with many, many customers, I had the opportunity to work with gigantic databases, and learned
		how to efficiently fetch and store data from it.</p>

		<p>In 2015, I participated in Microsoft's Student Accelerator Programme (MSA), where I learned how to make web apps,
		work with an API/client architecture, make Universal Windows Platform apps, and pitch new app prototypes to large audiences.</p>
		<p>MSA prepared me for this internship, where I learned a lot about current development trends, working closely with
		stakeholders, and how to be innovative in a large company.</p>
		<p>With two other interns, together we practised Agile methodologies, thoroughly researched biometrics and security
		requirements, and created mobile and wearable prototypes listed in the projects section below.</p>

				<h2>Pass Past</h2>
				<div class="subtitle-subtitle">Work together to solve previous exams.</div>

				<p><b>Features:</b> C#, ASP.NET MVC, Entity Framework, Razor, Git.</p>
				<p>Pass Past is a collaborative project currently in development between two other university students and myself.
				One of them, Fabian, is acting as the project manager and setting targets and goals for the other student, Ashray,
				and myself. We wanted a mid-year break project to work on to develop our development skills, and to learn C#,
				ASP.NET MVC and how to interact with databases.</p>
				<p>The problem we wanted to solve came about while studying previous
				exams at university, and classes used Google Docs to write what they thought the answers to each question were. This quickly
				became a mess of letters and comments, so we wanted to make an efficient and organized solution that all students could use easily.</p>
				<p>It works by having each student log in through Facebook or Google, then selecting the previous exam they want to record
				answers for, then voting with their answer to each question displayed like a poll. Each question has a comments section
				for discussion that will be weighted by it's vote count.</p>

				<h2>KPI Monitoring Tool</h2>
				<div class="subtitle-subtitle">Neatly sorts and displays huge amounts of data.</div>

				<p><b>Features:</b> PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, Redis, HTML.</p>
				<p>One of the projects assigned during my internship at Rakuten.</p>
				<p>Until this point, the sales team had to manually access the database, or make a request to see their KPIs.
				The KPI Monitor is a web app that sorts and displays their KPIs on a large TV screen for instant feedback, and giving the
				team in charge of the database a lighter work load!</p>
				<p>It can be filtered to display specific time frames, and show different breakdowns of data in a
				hamburger menu in the top left. This project also gave me experience using Unix and Vim for working in different development
				environments (local, staging), and I can now say I can navigate and code without using a mouse with confidence!</p>

				<h2>ASBeats</h2>
				<div class="subtitle-subtitle">Log in to your bank account using your heart!</div>

				<p><b>Features:</b> Java, Android development, mobile, wearables, innovative research.</p>
				<p>The first team project assigned during my internship at ASB Bank.</p>
				<p>We were investigating if new biometrics had progressed to the point where it was a feasible
				authentication method for logging in to your personal bank account. This was the prototype mobile and wearable app we created using
				a wrist device that recorded your ECG in real time to use as a password for your mobile bank app. This involved a lot of
				research, writing reports, conducting surveys, evaluating feedback and making presentations to stakeholders.</p>
				<p>I had no knowledge of Java or object-oriented programming before starting this project since the first year of university focused on
				Python programming, and picked up the necessary skills quickly to get a functional and intuitive prototype to demonstrate during
				presentations. It was a lot of fun learning how to make apps for both mobile and wearables, and progressing from testing on
				virtual machines to actual devices was very rewarding.</p>
